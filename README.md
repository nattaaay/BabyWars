# Baby Wars

A game similar to the classic retro game Space Invaders. The objective is to feed the babies (a.k.a shooting the aliens).

Defeat the babies by shooting bottles at them before they move closer to you!

# Getting Started

# Next Steps

- Fixing the bugs related to the keydown/bottle.

- Able to re-load the game after win or loss.

- Moving the babies as I want it. (Once it hits the border, it will move down and opposite direction.)

- Storing scores

- Apply styles and add images to make it look more presentable.

# Key Learning Points

- I learned the importance of scopes. I spent a lot of time debugging just because I placed variables at the wrong places.

- The importance of building a strong foundation in the fundamentals. This is going to help me go a looooong way. I'm planning to do this more.
